# Human-Tracking-System

We have made a human detection application using openCV in python.

We have given 2 options to the user

    1. Open a video file of any format and process it, 
       processing will detect human faces in the video and draw a rectangle around the faces.
    
    2. Open webcam and then human faces in front of the webcam will be detected (at run time).
    
We have used Tkinter for creating the GUI
And openCV's - haar cascade algorithm to detect faces.
